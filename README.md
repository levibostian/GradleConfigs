# GradleConfigs

Shareable config files for Gradle. 

*Note: I primarily use Gradle for Android development. These config files may be opinionated and designed to work for Android projects. It might or might not work for your Kotlin/Java project that is not Android.* 

# Getting started

This repository contains gradle files. At the top of each file you will see instructions on how to use that file.
